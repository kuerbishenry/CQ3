Mini-Max sum 

the time complexity of for loops is O(n) but I used Collections.sort has a time complexity of O(n log n) which takes precedence over O(n).

the space complexity is O(n), n is the number of integers



Hackerrack in a string 

the time complexity for my brute force solution is O(n) because of the for loop. the time complexity of my recursive attempt would also be O(n) because my bases cases
will stop the loop after it iterates through the string

the space complexity is O(n), n is the length of the string
